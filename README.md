### Small timer app to track daily progress towards goals

Working on a small application for practice on system design.

At the moment, just using python as my backend backed by SQLite to store daily information.
In the future, I want to build some kind of frontend with node/react with backend in js.

TBD:
- Visualize daily data
- Separate data out by days
- Nicer visuals, rather than just using the default built-ins
- Incentives for hitting the goals
- Actual backend to persist information
- Refactor database to store information per user
- Write out actual frontend
